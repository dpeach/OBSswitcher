# OBSswitcher
A box for switching between scenes on OBS Studio. It can mute/unmute audio and start/stop recording or streaming. This version uses an Arduino Pro Micro.
## Functionality
This is seen as a keyboard by the computer. Therefore, it can be plugged into a computer and used to control OXS with keyboard commands. The difference is that the commands are set up as buttons. The 8 buttons on the hardware can be used inside OBS Studio (or other application) to switch between scenes, mute/unmute audio inputs, and start/stop recordings or streams.
## Usage
Inside OBS Studio choose File | Settings and then select the Hotkeys tab. In each scene click input box for the hotkey you want to change and select a button on the OBS Switcher hardware. It will input the hotkey you have chosen.
